# ECSE 324 Lab 4 Specifiacrions

This lab requires us to use the high-level I/O capabilities of the DE1-SoC sumilator, CPULator, to implement a PS/2 keyboard port and a VGA display, both in assembly. 

Then, we are asked for a C-implementation of the Game of Life.

Finally, I must write two 1 page reports, following the remplate in the repo. 
- a performance analysis of the game of life grid drawing subroutines
- a performance analysis of game of life state and grid update subroutines. 

Please read the PDF `Lab4\F25 ECSE 324 Lab 4_ Keyboard and Display.pdf` for spec. 

Please modify `part1.s`, `part2.s`, and `part3.c` with the implementations. Well-comment the assembly codes. Keep whitespace to a minimum for the C-code.
