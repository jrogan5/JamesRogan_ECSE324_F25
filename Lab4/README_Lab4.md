# ECSE 324 Lab 4 Specifiacrions

This lab requires us to use the high-level I/O capabilities of the DE1-SoC sumilator, CPULator, to implement a PS/2 keyboard port and a VGA display, both in assembly. 

Then, we are asked for a C-implementation of the Game of Life.

Finally, I must write two 1 page reports, following the remplate in the repo. 
- a performance analysis of the game of life grid drawing subroutines
- a performance analysis of game of life state and grid update subroutines. 

Please modify `part1.s`, `part2.s`, and `part3.c` with GUIDES FOR ME TO FOLLOW TO COMPLETE the implementations. Well-comment the assembly codes. Keep whitespace to a minimum for the C-code. You can just do this wil comments, and like 50% of the necessary code, with instructions for the rest. You can define any constants that would just be tedious work, like the device address fields and bit shifting operations to get particular register values. But any logical stuff I want to implement.  

Please read the PDF `Lab4\F25 ECSE 324 Lab 4_ Keyboard and Display.pdf` for spec. Make sure every part is exactly compliant with the spec.
